These are all of my solutions from the 1st to the 8th Lecture from the JavaScript Applications course at SoftUni.

#THIS IS PART 1

What's included in the 1st Part: 
  1. Unit Testing and Modules;
  2. Rest Services and AJAX;
  3. Asynchronous Programming;
  4. Remote Databases;
  5. Templating;
  6. Routing;
  7. Workshop - Single Page Application;
  8. Design Patterns and Best Practices...
 
Solutions from:
  * Lab lecture exercises;
  * Exercise lecture exercises;

Some of the solutions are simpler than others. 
You might notice that I have used different techniques for some exercises, just because I wanted to experiment with which style might work the best for me.

I hope I could help students from the same learning path in SoftUni as me.
